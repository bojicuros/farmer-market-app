#### Administrative Section for Administrators

2. **Administrative Control Panel:**
   Administrators have access to a centralized control panel with essential system information. They can efficiently manage users (administrators and vendors), update user information, and approve new registrations. The administration section extends to overseeing marketplace information, enabling administrators to add new markets or mark existing ones as closed. Product information at selling points can be edited, and new products can be added.

#### Administrative Section for Vendors

3. **Vendor Management:**
   Vendors have a dedicated section where they can input daily prices for their products. Daily price adjustments can be made throughout the day, and vendors can visualize the pricing trends with a diagram displaying the product's price over the past 30 days. Additionally, vendors can compare their prices with those of other vendors in the same market.
